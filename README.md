# Integrated-project-Access-to-drinking-water

In this project I exhibit my Spreadsheet skills using Google sheets and I was able to perform all data import, retrieve, manipulation, cleaning, and visualization of the dataset.

Understanding the data,  we’ll investigate access to safe and affordable drinking water.

[You can access the main project solutions Google spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VKogBApZeoFOVw0v_qDp6wEy-GAEuo3m0rX0wJ0HdGA/edit?gid=1722416536#gid=1722416536)
